<title> Lining Wang </title>

Hi, I'm Lining!  
<br>
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Yale in 2017, where I conducted research in security, cryptography and networking under the supervision of Bryan Ford & Richard Yang. 
<br>
After that I was an engineer on the Production Security Operations team at Slack, where I wore many hats as a software developer, infrastructure & service engineer, on-call responder, and incident commander.  I also contributed to <a href="https://github.com/slackhq/nebula">Nebula</a>, a mutually authenticated peer-to-peer software defined network based on the Noise Protocol Framework, now open-sourced under the MIT license.
